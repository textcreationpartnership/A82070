            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:116197:3"/>And in as much as we finde it in theſe our dayes to be the policie of adverſaries, to cloath us in the skins of Savage beaſts, that is to father ſuch opinions, and faſten ſuch imputations upon us to engage the world againſt us, and to provoke all men to fall upon us, as, in which if there were matter of truth anſwerable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, would indeed render us unworthy the ſociety of men. And for as much alſo as there are ſome ſad examples in the Land, of the vanity and wickedneſſe of ſomemen, who, having profeſſed the ſame way of worſhiping God, &amp; been called by the ſame name with our ſelves, have ſo farre fallen from the grace of God and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their profeſſion, as not onely to doe things inconvenient and unworthy the name of Chriſtians, yea of men, but alſo to juſtifie themſelves therein as well-doers, to the great reproach of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the breaking of our hearts, and the offence of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom they have laid <hi>the ſtumbling blocke of their iniquity;</hi>
'wee cannot but judge, that, both in relation to the Goſpell it ſelfe, (the honour of which is in great part involved in the innocency and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of thoſe people that hold it out unto the world, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſuffers in their reproaches) as likewiſe in relation to men of the world, ſtrangers to God, who harden themſelves againſt the way of God and his ſervants upon the fore-mentioned occaſion (the undeceiving and enlightning of whom lyes upon us as a duty to be endeavoured:) yea and in relation to our owne innocency and integrity, the which we are bound to vindicate on this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: a neceſſity lyes upon us to doe ſome act, by which the truth and reallity of our judgements and principles touching thoſe things, wherein we ſo undeſervedly ſuffer in the thoughts of men, may be brought out into an open light, to be beheld and known of all men; which then (we doubt not) will be found to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe, then what many have fancied them to be.</p>
            <p>We are very ſenſible that ſome men have even filled the world with the noyſe of their out-cryes againſt us, as if wee were the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates of all licentious liberty, diſorder and confuſion; but, how unjuſtly, will one day appeare to their ſhame.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is pleaded for.</note>It is true, we have aſſerted that as belonging unto men, which in ſome reſpect and conſideration may be called a <hi>liberty.</hi> But what <hi>liberty?</hi> Not a <hi>liberty</hi> to harme any man in word or deed:<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116197:3"/>nor a
<hi>liberty</hi> for any man to be corrupt, vaine, looſe or inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in judgment, or converſation: for ſuch a <hi>liberty</hi> as this can doe no man good. And God that knowes our hearts knowes that we deſire not any
<hi>liberty</hi> for any, but in order to the good of all.</p>
            <p>We have indeed thought this but reaſonable; That while men behave themſelves peaceably and juſtly as touching civill conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, making no encroachments upon the Civill power, nor any breaches upon the names and reputations, the eſtates or bodies of men, nor doing things inconſiſtent with morall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; they ſhould not ſuffer in their names, bodies, or eſtates from the hands of the Civill Magiſtrate, or any other men who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, meerely for what they conſcientiouſly do, in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>And when we ſo ſay; wee doe not all exempt from correction any ſuch offences or miſcarriages of men, as are about matters meerely Eccleſiaſticall, and which are committed againſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Scepter of Chriſts Kingdome onely: provided it be by power and meanes ſuitable to the nature of ſuch tranſgreſſions. The which power and meanes, wee conceive to be the Word of God and Divine Cenſures: which as they are proper in kinde to correct and cure ſuch inordinacies and delinquencies as theſe; ſo are they mighty in power and efficacy to effectuate the ſame. <hi>Being able through God</hi> (who hath appointed them for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) <hi>to pull downe ſtrong holds, to caſt downe imaginations, and every high thing that exalts it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God, to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge all diſobedience, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4,5,6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And God who hath made nothing in vaine, having once found one kinde of meanes fit for his hand to accompliſh his end by, is not wont to conſtitute another for the ſame purpoſe. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which principle of truth the Apoſtle builds a great aſſertion, accompanied with an aſſeveration. For (ſaith hee) <hi>if there had beene a law given which could have given life,</hi> verily righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116197:4"/>ſhould have beene by the Law.
<note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 3.21.</note> If the Law had beene given by God for that end, that men might bee juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it, hee would then never have inſtituted another way and meanes, ſuch as is that which is by faith, for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And therefore wee conceive, that with the ſame reaſon and truth it may bee aſſerted, that if God hath inſtituted and made a ſpirituall power, ſpirituall engines and inſtruments, both proper and effectuall remedies againſt ſuch evills as oppoſe a ſpirituall power and ſtate only (the affirmative whereof is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved) then hee hath not ſuperadded another power and meanes, and that of an inferiour nature, ſuch as is that which is but ſecular, for the ſame end.</p>
            <p>And as there is both ſuiteableneſſe of proportion,

               </gap>nd ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of ſtrength in the Evangelicall and ſpirituall power to heale ſuch diſtempers in men as theſe are, ſo wee conceive the Civill power to bee deficient in both.

<note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.</note> the direct and proper operations and effects of it, are not like to bee ſpirituall. Becauſe all proper effects are at moſt but commenſurable to the nature and being of their cauſes. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh</hi>

               <note n="o" place="margin">1 Tim. 5 8, 16.</note> Undoubtedly, either there was a difference between the Churches ſtocke and that which particular perſons did poſſeſſe, or elſe the Apoſtle muſt needs ſpeak very impertinently, the later of which to aſſert, were to blaſpheme that Spirit by which he wrote.</p>

But though theſe Chriſtians acted ſo, as if they had had no intereſt, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in their Eſtates, yet certainly a propriety they had, nor was this propriety diſſolved meerly by their becomming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as appeares plainly by what was ſpoken by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> to
<hi>Ananias,</hi> who was in pretence one of thoſe bountifull Benefactours afore mentioned.</p>
            <p>For the Apoſtle in reproving him for his diſſmulation, in pretending to dedicate to common uſe the whole price of his poſſeſſion, being ſold, when as hee reſerved part thereof unto himſelfe: ſaith thus unto him, <hi>Whilest it remained, was it not thine own?

               <note n="t" place="margin">Acts. 5.4.</note> By which double interrogation the Apoſtle doth emphatically grant and affirme a particular and diſtinct right which hee, and ſo conſequently thoſe other Benefactors had to their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116197:8"/>both before they had ſold them and after, unleſſe they had paſſed the ſame away by a voluntary act of donation or free gift.</p>
            <p>If therefore God hath built up a wall of ſeperation between the eſtates of men and men, the affirmative whereof ſufficiently appeares by many acts of his will, then farre be it from us who profeſſe our ſelves to be his ſervants, that we ſhould indevour to throw it downe.</p>
            <p>And in as much as thoſe Apoſtolicall Churches themſelves recorded in the Scriptures, in which the glory and power of the Goſpell ruled, were not altogether free from ſuch perſons as <hi>turned the grace of God into wantonneſſe,</hi>

            <p>And therefore our Saviour referring to the firſt inſtitution of marriage for correction of ſome corruptions and abuſes of men about marriage, ſaith, <hi>Have yee not read, that hee which made them at the beginning, made them male and female? for this cauſe ſhall a man leave father and mother, and ſhall cleave to his wife, and they twaine</hi> (not they three or they foure, <hi>but they twaine</hi>) <hi>ſhall bee one fleſh.</hi>
